# w3u-m3u8-converter
Short and hacky script that transforms w3u lists to m3u8.
## Usage
You'll need Python 3.7+
Run the script in a folder with .w3u files and it'll output .m3u8 files with the same name.
You can execute it with the flag --no-extra-flags (hehe) to include userAgent keys as (#EXTVLCOPT:http-user-agent) tags
## Suggestions, improvements, bugs, etc
Open an issue and I'll check them out. For example, a m3u to w3u conversor should be really easy to do.
